Quantization
Dealing damage is qunatized, meaning physical/elemental damage round to the nearest multiple of 1/16th of their attacks base damage before beign multiplied further.
By using this method, the percision of data is reduced resulting in less storage spaced used and improved computer operation efficency.
Rather than a lengthy integer of each element's value, only one "total" integer along with short representative multiples of 1/16th need to be communicated.
Scale = (Modded Base Damage) / 16
